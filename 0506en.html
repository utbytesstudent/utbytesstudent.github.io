            <h2>First Post</h2>
            <p>There are several purposes for this blog. First and foremost, it's for documentation, it's very easy to forget things if you
                don't write them down. But of course, it's also to be able to share my experiences with friends and family. The final purpose
                is the technical aspect. I've used HTML before, but not CSS. Becoming more comfortable with computers can never hurt.</p>
