            <h2>A Week in Italy</h2>
            <p>It feels like I just landed, but I've been here for 7 days now.

            <h2>From Kronor to Euro</h2>
            <p>
                Everywhere I've shopped, I can pay with a card. It has worked well, but Handelsbanken/Mastercard (I'm not sure which) adds a small exchange fee every time I shop. It's only 1-2%, so it's not a big deal, but you can get a better exchange rate.
                <br><br>
                I opened a bank account with Revolut. There, I can exchange money without a fee. I just tried transferring Kronor from my Handelsbanken account to Revolut, converted to Euro, and then paid my rent via PayPal, which I linked to my Revolut account. It worked flawlessly and only took a minute.
                <br><br>
                So far, my bank card with Revolut is only "virtual," but I have ordered a physical card that should arrive next week.

            <h2>Ice Cream and Sightseeing</h2>
            <p>
                On Wednesday, I met another exchange student. She is from Germany, studying economics, and is also here on an Erasmus exchange for half a year. We had pizza for lunch and then took the cable car up to a mountain with a nice view of the city. We took some pictures and then went back down to have ice cream.

                I already knew that Italians are famous for their ice cream, and they have every right to be. So far, I have had ice cream at three different places, and they have all been delicious.
                <br><br>
                In Sweden, I rarely find scoop ice cream to be worth the price. Here in Italy, the ice cream is a little cheaper than in Sweden, but above all, it's much tastier. Ice cream shops make their own ice cream, and my favorite so far is probably the bergamot sorbet I had yesterday.

            <h5>Archaeological Museum.</h5>
            <p>
                Yesterday, the German exchange student and I visited a museum with ruins from the ancient Roman city that was located where Trento stands today. We saw what remained of roads, houses with underfloor heating, mosaics, and sewage systems.
