            <h2>Suffered a Concussion</h2>
            <p>Two weeks ago, my friend and I visited Venice. I was pleasantly surprised by Venice, but the end of the trip didn't go as I had expected.

            <h5>Crowds on Some Streets</h5>
            <p>
                I was a bit worried that it would be like Disneyland throughout the city. However, even though there are streets full of tourist traps, there are also streets empty of people, feeling like a typical Italian town. Of course, it may have helped that we were there in October and not during the peak season.

            <h5>But Empty on Others</h5>
            <p>
                Another thing that surprised me was how extremely similar Venice and Kotor in Montenegro are. This is not surprising since Kotor was part of the Venetian Republic from 1420 to 1797 and was built by people from Venice (Venetians?). The difference is that Kotor has no canals, no palaces, is much smaller, but it is in much better condition. Kotor is more like a museum, while Venice is a fairly run-down Italian city. However, around 20 million tourists visit Venice every year, so it's not surprising that it shows its marks.

            <h5>Me in Venice</h5>
            <p>
                Anyway, after two days in Venice, it was time to go home. My friend quickly took the fast train to Munich and then continued on to Sweden. So, I took the train to Trento on my own. I was exhausted from walking for two days straight. In Venice, there is no public transportation since the streets are half a meter wide. According to Google Maps, I walked 3 miles over the two days, but it might even have been an understatement since you constantly get lost on the narrow streets.
                <br><br>
                I changed trains in Verona and boarded the overcrowded train to Trento. When we were about halfway, my body gave up, and I fainted. The fellow passengers on the train were very kind; they told me what was happening, and a man gave me his focaccia to raise my blood sugar a bit. I called my landlord who picked me up at the station.
                <br><br>
                By that time, I was feeling quite bad, utterly exhausted. I had a bit of a neck and head ache, but I didn't realize then that I had hit my head quite hard.
                <br><br>
                The landlord asked if I wanted to go to the hospital, but I didn't want to. I had fainted before, albeit a long time ago, but what I needed to recover was rest.
                <br><br>
                The next day, I went to university as usual, but I quickly realized that I didn't understand what the teacher was saying. He spoke clear English, and the lecture was all about basic statistics, something I already knew. However, I couldn't understand anything he was saying, and I had trouble keeping my eyes open. Moreover, I realized that I was still feeling nauseous.
                <br><br>
                I called 1177, who thought I should visit a health center. So, I called one of the English-speaking doctors recommended by the university. I told the secretary about the situation, and she said that I had the highest priority, and the doctor would call me back. That was the last I heard. The doctor never called me, and when I tried to call the secretary again, I only got a voicemail.
                <br><br>
                On Tuesday, my landlord and I went to a pharmacy to check if my blood pressure was okay. My blood pressure was completely normal. The pharmacist quickly examined the inside of my eyelids and said that my nausea was due to anemia. He sold me a jar of multivitamins, and for the pain in my neck, he recommended Voltaren.

            <h5>Emergency Room in Trento</h5>
            <p>
                I wasn't entirely convinced by the pharmacist's assessment and still wanted to see a real doctor. So, on Wednesday, my landlord managed to schedule an appointment for me at the health center she usually goes to. The doctor there said that I probably had a concussion and that I should go to the emergency room immediately for a head X-ray to ensure I didn't have any internal head bleeding.
                <br><br>
                So, we went to the emergency room, and I stayed there for nearly 6 hours. In the emergency room, they checked everything, blood pressure, blood tests, EKG, CT scan. I was given a drip with "anti-nausea medication" and a collar around my neck to stabilize it. However, all the tests came back negative, and at 1 in the morning, I was finally able to go home. The blood test showed that I didn't have anemia at all. And I shouldn't take any NSAID medications, including Voltaren, since it has a blood-thinning effect, which should be avoided with a concussion.

            <h5>Me right after they X-rayed my head.</h5>
            <p>
                Since then, I haven't done much. The first few days, I just lay in my room with the light off. But my nausea and fatigue have slowly but surely decreased.
                <br><br>
                I'm very lucky to have the accommodation I have; my landlord has not only driven me all over the city and arranged a doctor's appointment for me, but in the first few days after the accident, she also cooked for me and made sure I had everything I needed.
                <br><br>
                Last week, I went to the university a few times. I probably should have stayed at home, but I had an exam and a presentation that I felt I wanted to attend. So I did. Surprisingly, I think I passed the exam. And I remembered to say everything I needed to during the presentation. So, I consider it a great success.
                <br><br>
                It's been 17 days since I fainted and hit my head. 
                <br><br>
                As long as I take it easy, I have no symptoms, but I get a headache when I think and feel nauseous when I take the bus. It doesn't help that the bus drivers here in Trento drive extremely jerkily. You really have to hold on even if you're sitting down.
                <br><br>
                And it's a bit problematic to get a headache from thinking when you're a student. I attend some lectures I feel are important and otherwise stay at home.
                <br><br>
                I still get dizzy from taking a brisk walk, but my bumps on my head have disappeared, and I no longer have neck pain.
                <br><br>
                So, slowly but surely, it's getting better.
                <br><br>
                Next time I take a train, I'll probably wear a helmet.
