            <h2>Start of the Semester</h2>
            <p>For the past two weeks, I've spent my days meeting other exchange students, visiting various attractions, enjoying delicious food, and relaxing. But today, the vacation was over, and it was time to begin what I actually came here for.

                When the schedule for the fall semester came out, it turned out that one of the courses I had chosen, Animal Models of Disease, clashed with my other classes. I was advised that before deciding on an alternative course, I should attend the first lecture to see if it suits me.
                <br><br>

                <h2>Time for a Lecture</h2>
                <p>
                So today, I attended the first lecture of the course "Laboratory of Biological Data Mining." The prerequisite mentioned having "Basic knowledge of probability theory and programming skills in Python, R, or another language." Uncertain if I actually had the required prerequisites, I went there anyway because the course seemed interesting.
                <br><br>
                The lecture itself operated exactly like in Umeå. The teacher began by explaining the course structure and some important dates. Then we had a 10-minute stretch break before delving into some actual material. I had heard that in Italy, they are not as strict with time as in Sweden, but this teacher started right on schedule.
                <br><br>
                At the beginning of the lecture, everyone had to introduce themselves with their names and what they were studying. This course is offered to multiple master's programs: Computer Science, Quantitative and Computational Biology, and Mathematics. There were about 15 students in the classroom, and at least half of them didn't seem to know each other from before.
                <br><br>
                </p>
                <h2>Not the Only Swede</h2>
                <p>
                I was surprised when one of the students introduced himself as an exchange student from Sweden. Even more surprising was during the break when we talked to each other, and it turned out he is studying biotechnology in Umeå, the same program as me. The difference is that he is one year ahead of me. I thought I recognized him when I first entered the classroom, but I thought maybe I had seen him somewhere in Trento last week.
                <br><br>
                Anyway, this is the only course we have in common since he's following the bioinformatics track in Umeå and therefore taking other courses related to mathematics and computer science.
                <br><br>
                But while we were talking, one of the Italian students joined the conversation, speaking Swedish. He apparently went to high school in Uppsala and could therefore speak Swedish.
                <br><br>
                It all felt a bit strange considering that I hadn't met anyone in the past two weeks with ties to Sweden.

            <p>
                
                The other courses I've chosen don't start until September 25 for some reason, which is in 2 weeks. Actually, it's quite nice as I get a bit of a soft start.
                <br><br>
                Furthermore, I probably wouldn't have been able to handle a packed schedule right now as I've caught a bad cold. Last Saturday, I was completely knocked out with a headache and a sore throat. Now, it's just the stuffy nose and the sore throat that remain, but I'm not completely recovered.
