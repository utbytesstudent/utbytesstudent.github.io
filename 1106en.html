            <h2>The Snow is Here</h2>
            <p>For a few weeks now, the long and warm summer has ended, and autumn has arrived. The leaves are changing colors, and it's raining a lot.

                It rained for several days in a row, and on Friday, suddenly, one could see snow on the mountaintops. Even though it's 10 degrees and raining in the valley, it's snowing on the mountain peaks. Not surprising when you think about it, but it was not what I expected.

                Now it has been around zero degrees even here in the valley, so I expect the snow cover to slowly make its way down along the mountains.

                However, the average temperature for Trento in January is apparently +2 degrees, so I don't expect snow levels similar to Ume√•.
