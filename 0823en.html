            <h2>How to Get Accepted for Exchange Studies in Italy</h2>
            <p>
                So, how do you go about studying biotechnology in Italy for a semester? Unfortunately, there's no set protocol to follow, and everyone you ask will give you different answers. But here's how I did it.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h3>A Starting Point</h3>
            <p>
                During my second year of studies, I contacted the international coordinator at my institution. 
                I learned that there are different types of agreements. If you want to go outside of Europe, the university-wide agreements apply. 
                These spots are highly competitive, and you need to be active in Umeå University's reception of exchange students from other countries to have a chance.
                <br><br>For agreements within my institution, things looked different. The coordinator said that everyone who applies usually gets their first choice, but they only have agreements with universities within Europe. Since I was interested in going within Europe, it suited me well.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h3>Choosing the University</h3>
            <p>
                A year later, I began going through the list of universities my institution had agreements with. Some universities and countries were immediately ruled out. Germany was impossible because they have three terms instead of two, which practically meant I would need to study an extra semester in Umeå when I returned.
                Then I visited each university's website to find their course offerings. Just because they have an agreement with my institution doesn't necessarily mean they have courses in English within molecular biology. Finding the universities' course offerings is challenging. Some universities I never managed to find course offerings for, despite thoroughly reading their websites and sending emails to responsible individuals. I had to discard these universities, even if they might have been interesting.
                <br><br>
                Initially, I decided on the University of Dundee in Scotland. It seemed like a nice city and they had interesting courses. However, due to Brexit, things became complicated. It wasn't even certain that their agreements would be renewed for the fall of 2023.
                Then I found the University of Trento.
            </p>

                <br>
            <p>
                 The university offers many courses in English within Cellular, Computational and Integrative Biology, and the comfortably sized town is beautifully situated between the mountains, bordering the Dolomites.
                Italy also seemed like a good country to go to. I've never been there, but of course, I've heard a lot about the country. I'll have the chance to improve my language skills while still being able to communicate in English. Furthermore, the city is far north, along the railway. Both Austria and Germany are just a train ride away, offering ample opportunities to travel to other countries in Central Europe.
            </p>   
            <br> 
            <h3>The Application</h3>
            <p>
                Winter 2023 arrived, and it was time to submit a formal application. Easier said than done. I had to fill out various online forms on different websites, and it hardly ever worked. But despite it all, I finally managed to submit my application.
            </p>
            <br>
            <img src="https://i.imgur.com/q23kDN6.png" alt="Results of the exchange studies selection" class="imageb"> 
            <h5>Umeå University nominates me for exchange studies.</h5>
            <br>
            <p>
                And a few weeks later, I received an email stating that I had been accepted. Then I needed to fill out even more forms. Essentially the same information in every one. Additionally, it was time to choose courses. I selected the following courses:
            </p>
            <br>
                <ul>
                    <li>Cell therapy</li>
                    <li>Gene therapy</li>
                    <li>Molecular basis of disease</li>
                    <li>Animal models of disease</li>
                </ul> 
            <br>
            <p>
                Whether I'll actually take these courses remains to be seen, as there could potentially be schedule clashes. But if that's the case, I'll adjust the courses on-site.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h3>Can I Go Now?</h3>
            <p>
                The University of Trento didn't provide much information initially, but one thing was clear: they don't assist Erasmus students in finding accommodation. I had to do that myself. Most companies seemed to only rent out rooms/apartments for at least 12 months, so I decided to find a private landlord.
                <br><br>
                I posted in a local Facebook group for housing seekers, and after a day, I received a response from a woman who was renting out a room + bathroom in her townhouse. €450 per month, all-inclusive, including weekly cleaning. It was a higher standard than I initially thought, but the Erasmus grant is substantial (€510 per month), and it actually feels quite nice not to have to share a kitchen or bathroom with other students.
                <br><br>
                I contacted other landlords but never received any responses, probably because I wrote in English. So after a video call with the woman, it was decided. I also don't need to pay anything until I arrive.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h3>Leaving Umeå</h3>
            <p>
                Before I could leave Umeå, there were preparations to be made. The aquarium was emptied, and the shrimps were sold. I gave away several potted plants to friends, and I donated a large portion of my belongings and clothes. I applied for permission to sublet my student room and signed a contract with a prospective student from Landskrona. She'll be renting my room while I'm away.
            </p>

            <h5>The room is empty and the suitcase is packed.</h5>
            <br>
            <p>
                I packed my suitcase and bought a one-way ticket to Italy.
                On Saturday, I'll be flying from Arlanda to Venice and then taking a FlixBus to Trento. In Trento, my landlord will pick me up at the bus station. Then I have two weeks in Trento before the term starts. There should be plenty of time to settle in. Perhaps some other exchange students have already moved there, whom I can meet. Maybe during these two weeks, I'll visit other parts of the country. Time will tell.
                <br>
                Goodbye for now,
            </p>
