            <h2>First Days in Italy</h2>
            <p>
                Last Saturday, I arrived at my accommodation at 9 in the evening. The bed was made and everything was prepared. My landlord asked if I wanted something light to eat. I said yes, and it turned out that the "something light and simple" was homemade ravioli and homemade watermelon juice. It was delicious.

                When I woke up the next day, I went out to the patio to talk to the landlord, but I also met a neighbor there who spoke to me in Danish. Normally, I find it difficult to understand spoken Danish, but he spoke the most understandable Danish I've ever heard. Apparently, his mother was from Denmark.

                Then I got a ride into town. My accommodation is a bit outside the city, surrounded by vineyards. It takes 10-15 minutes to take the bus to the city center, and the bus runs at least every 20 minutes. Actually, I can't really complain, but in Ume√•, I lived "closer" to everything. However, the University of Trento is spread out throughout the city. The department I will be studying at is also outside the city, closer to my accommodation, not within walking distance but definitely within cycling distance.

                Down in town, I had lunch and explored the city center. Trento has a relatively large center with picturesque old houses, pedestrian streets, and churches. Then I went to Lidl and bought groceries. It might not be very adventurous to buy the exact same pasta and crushed tomatoes that I buy at home in Sweden. But you don't always have to be adventurous. I will be here for half a year, so I have time.

                When I got home, it started raining heavily, and it continued to rain all night. It's supposed to be rainy for a few days now, but I don't mind. I prefer rain and 20 degrees over sun and 35 degrees.

                Today, I realized that Trento barely has any sunrise or sunset since the city is situated in a valley surrounded by high mountains. I've never thought that you need a horizon to be able to see a sunset, but it's actually quite logical.
            <br>  <br>  
                I'll take it easy in the upcoming days. I don't feel a strong urge to travel right now. I'll also try to get in touch with some other exchange students who have already arrived here. I've become a member of Trento University's association for Erasmus students, maybe I'll go downtown and pick up my membership card tomorrow.

                Now I'm going to have pyttipanna for dinner.
