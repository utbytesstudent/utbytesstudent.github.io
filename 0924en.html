            <h2>Renting a room</h2>
            <p>
                When I first moved to Umeå, I was a lodger in an apartment on Stipendiegränd. The apartment was worn, but the family was nice. After a few months, I got the contract for my corridor room on Nydalahöjden, where I've been living for almost 4 years now. So, living with others is nothing new to me.
                <br><br>
                Here in Italy, I'm lodging with a woman, her husband, two cats, and an aquarium with fish. I have my own room and bathroom but share the kitchen.

            <h2>Finding Accommodation on Your Own</h2>
            <p>
                When I was looking for accommodation, I thought 450 euros was quite a lot. In Umeå, I can get a whole apartment for that price. But after coming here and talking to many other Erasmus students, I haven't met anyone who pays less than me in rent.
                <br><br>
                Most pay around 500-550 euros per month for an apartment they share with other students. The rooms are often small, you share a bathroom, and the furniture is worn.
                <br><br>
                I think it's a bit disappointing that the University of Trento doesn't help Erasmus students find accommodation. Exchange students are in a somewhat vulnerable situation. It's self-evident that it's not easy to try to find accommodation in a country you may have never been to, with a housing shortage, and where you don't understand the language.
                <br><br>
                Many Erasmus students get deceived or exploited. In Umeå, the university offers accommodation in corridors for all exchange students, including those from EU countries. It feels wrong that a significant portion, or all, of the Erasmus grant should go to stingy or even criminal landlords.
                <br><br>
                Anyway, I started looking for accommodation well in advance and seem to have been lucky.
                <br><br>

            <h2>My Accommodation</h2>
            <p>
                Before 2020, my landlord rented out this room through Airbnb, but during COVID, it became impossible, so she started renting it out mainly to guest researchers and exchange students at the university. But she manages it somewhat like it's still an Airbnb.
                <br><br>

            <h5>A "balcony" connected to my bathroom.</h5>
            <p>
                On Sundays, it's time to wash sheets and towels, so if I'm going out during the day, I make sure my room is cleared before I leave. When I come back, I have freshly washed sheets. And on the made bed, there are two freshly washed folded towels, just like if you were staying in a hotel. I don't need to clean my bathroom either.
                <br><br>
                I once tried to help with unloading the dishwasher, but I was politely told that I didn't need to do that.
                <br><br>
                Ideally, I would have wanted my own apartment with a kitchenette. But I haven't met anyone else who has that, so I don't think it's common.
                <br><br>

            <h5>The bike I get to borrow.</h5>
            <p>
                My landlord has also been very helpful. The other day, they fixed up a bike that I can borrow while I'm here. I'll use the bike to get to the university. I can use it to cycle down to town. Emphasis on "down" to town. It's only 4 km, and I don't have to cycle on any busy roads. But I live on the slope of a high mountain. It's fun to go downhill for 4 km, but not to cycle uphill for 4 km.

            <h5>The building where I have my classes isn't very impressive on the outside, but the view is nice.</h5>
            <p>
                The university building where I study is at the same elevation as my accommodation, so even though the road there isn't completely flat, it's still okay.
                <br><br>
                I normally cook my own meals in the kitchen. I have my own shelf in the fridge and pantry. Things like cooking oil, salt, spices, and cleaning supplies I don't need to buy myself; we share them.

            <p>
                Sometimes, I've been invited to dinner. On two occasions, "former tenants," people who had previously rented my room, came to visit, and I was also invited. Another time, my landlord had picked mushrooms in the forest and made a risotto she wanted to treat me to. Every time, the food has been very delicious. But it can be a bit awkward sitting at a table where I'm the only one who can't speak Italian, and some others can't speak English.
