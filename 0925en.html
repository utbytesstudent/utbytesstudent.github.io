            <h2>Excursions</h2>
            <p>During the past four weeks, I've participated in many excursions and activities. It usually starts with someone in the group chat™ with exchange students asking who wants to go to a lake or something similar in the coming days. Typically, between 2 to 10 people show up.

                The first excursion I joined in this way was to Trento's science museum. It was especially interesting for me since I worked at Umeå's science museum Curiosum during the spring and summer. However, this was something completely different. Six floors that included, among other things, dinosaur skeletons, an artificial glacier, a large greenhouse with waterfalls, and many aquariums.

                I have visited three lakes: Lago di Caldonazzo, Lago di Levico, and Lago di Toblino. The best place to swim is Caldonazzo. The water is very clean and at a pleasant temperature. Some complained that it was cold, but it was still warmer than Swedish lakes in July.

                At Toblino, swimming was not allowed as the lake was part of a nature reserve. But we walked around the lake and enjoyed the extremely idyllic surroundings.

                I have also hiked in the mountains. We took the bus up to Monte Bondone and hiked a 10 km route. It was very pleasant and moderately challenging, but unfortunately, the mountain peaks were inside a cloud. So, there wasn't much of a view even though we were over 2000 meters above sea level.

                Last week, we visited orrido di ponte alto in Trento. It's a gorge right next to the city with several artificial dams. The dams were built in the 16th and 18th centuries to protect Trento from mud and debris that would otherwise be carried by the river and bury the city.

                Last Saturday, I and three others took the train to Bolzano. It felt like we had crossed the border to Austria. All signs were in German and Italian. They were selling sausages with bread instead of pizza on street corners, and the houses felt typical of Austria. We also visited the archaeological museum there, where we could see Ötzi. The 5000-year-old man found in a glacier 30 years ago. We ended the day in Trento with Japanese ramen.

                I have also participated in some of ESN Trento's activities. ESN stands for Erasmus Student Network and is an association run by students in Trento. First, they organized a flea market with items left by previous semester's exchange students. Everything was free; you just had to take it if you liked something. I chose a scarf. I have also attended two dinners organized by ESN.
